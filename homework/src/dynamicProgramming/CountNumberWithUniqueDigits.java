/**
 *
 * Given a non-negative integer n, count all numbers with unique digits, x, where 0 ≤ x < 10n.

 Example:
 Given n = 2, return 91. (The answer should be the total numbers in the range of 0 ≤ x < 100,
 excluding [11,22,33,44,55,66,77,88,99])

 Following the hint. Let f(n) = count of number with unique digits of length n.

 f(1) = 10. (0, 1, 2, 3, ...., 9)

 f(2) = 9 * 9. Because for each number i from 1, ..., 9, we can pick j to form a 2-digit number ij and there are 9 numbers that are different from i for j to choose from.

 f(3) = f(2) * 8 = 9 * 9 * 8. Because for each number with unique digits of length 2, say ij, we can pick k to form a 3 digit number ijk and there are 8 numbers that are different from i and j for k to choose from.

 Similarly f(4) = f(3) * 7 = 9 * 9 * 8 * 7....

 ...

 f(10) = 9 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * ... * 1

 f(11) = 0 = f(12) = f(13)....

 any number with length > 10 couldn't be unique digits number.

 The problem is asking for numbers from 0 to 10^n. Hence return f(1) + f(2) + .. + f(n)
